# Recsys-2023
Welcome to Recys 2023! This is a recommendation system implementation using TensorFlow, Random Forest, and XGBoost.This README file will guide you through the setup and usage of the system

# Model
Recys 2023 utilizes three different models for making recommendations:

TensorFlow: A deep learning framework widely used for building and training neural networks. The TensorFlow model in this system is designed to handle complex patterns and generate recommendations based on user-item interactions.

Random Forest: A popular ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions. The Random Forest model in this system leverages the power of decision trees to provide accurate recommendations.

XGBoost: An optimized gradient boosting framework known for its speed and performance. The XGBoost model in this system is capable of handling large-scale datasets efficiently and producing high-quality recommendations.

By using multiple models, Recys 2023 aims to provide diverse and reliable recommendations to users.
